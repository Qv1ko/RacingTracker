## About

RacingTracker is a free and open source web application that allows you to manage races in the world of motor racing with an innovative scoring system.

### Why RacingTracker?

In motor racing, the predominant scoring system is based exclusively on the final position of the participants. This traditional approach assigns fixed scores to each position without considering key factors such as relative performance, prior expectations or the particular conditions of each driver or team. As a result, the current system has two main shortcomings:

1. **Lack of recognition of relative performance**: A driver or team with limited resources who achieves a modest result could be performing at an exceptional level based on their capabilities, but the system does not reflect this merit.

2. **Little appreciation for exceeding expectations**: A pilot from a leading team who finishes in a high position simply meets expectations, without receiving additional recognition if his performance exceeds initial projections.

These limitations raise a fundamental question: is a scoring system that only considers final position without assessing context and relative performance really equitable? The answer, from my perspective, is no. I therefore propose the development of a fairer and more dynamic ranking system, capable of more accurately reflecting the true merit of each driver and team.
